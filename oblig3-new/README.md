     # The story of frogs

     ## Project overview and purpose.
     For this project we wanted to shead light on how frogs are indicator species for a good environment, and what that entails.
     Showing how frogs are sensitive to their environment is supposed to show a different side to the effects of pollution, where the
     affected are the frogs we all know and love.

     This is connected to the Sustainability Goal 15; Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss.

     ## Points discussed during the braimstorming session.
     Discussed if we should include other species that also ar indicators and helpers for the environment.
     We decidet to only focus on the frogs because of the timeframe of the project and because it would be more complex and take more time
     to add several stories of the different species.

     ## Docunentation about the Storyboard created before implementing the website.
     We had a brainstorming session where we drew sketches of what we thought would be important to add into the story.
     Pictures from our brainstorming session and our storyboard sketches are added in the folder 'Sketches'.
     

     ## Instructions for getting started and link to Github pages.

     ## Technology stack employed and list of animations, interactions and observers implemented.
     Intersection Observer, call-back function, eventlistener, keyframe animation, transformation.

     ## Problems along the way

     We had some issues with the intersectionObserver and weren't able to get the animations to be triggered by scrolling. In the end we had to restructure the whole page and with some help we managed to set up a functional JavaScript code.
